Or 'Hello, World'!

I remember the first time I used those words. It was October 2003. After dabbling in programming for a few years, I finally took the plunge and decided to make a career out of it by signing up to do a computing course - HND Computing (Software Engineering) - at [Hull College](http://www.hull-college.ac.uk) followed by a top-up year to BSc at the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/).

I'd been to Hull College a few years previous to do a GNVQ in Advanced Science. I ended up getting accepted to a course in Aberdeen but decided that I'd make more money working at McDonald's as a manager than I would as a fully qualified geneticist, so I followed the money until I finally realised how soul-sucking McDonald's was.

But I digress...

I've accumulated several programming books over the years. My favourite is still [Software Engineering](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Software-Engineering-Ian-Sommerville/0137035152) by Ian Sommerville. It's required reading on practically any course. My first, however, was a book about Java. I forget the name of it, and a quick search of my Amazon order history going back to 2002 doesn't show it so I must have bought it in one of those old-timey bookshops people used to go to.

In it, were the immortal words at the top of this post. `Saluton, Mondo!`. Even now, I still prefer those over Hello, World. No idea why.
